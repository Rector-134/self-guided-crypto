# Self Guided Cryptography Course

Self guided crypto source using (mostly) freely available online material and resources, organized in org-mode.

The primary academic resource is Cristof Paar's Introduction to Cryptography lecture series available on YouTube. His book, Understanding Cryptography,
as well as a supplemental book, Cryptography Engineering by Ferguson, Schneier and Kohno, was also used. Cracking Codes with Python by Sweigart was referrenced
in order to solve some of the programming challenges, as this whole endeavor served the parallel purpose of me teaching myself Python. The books are the only non-free resources.

Exercises from the books that I personally considered worthwhile are reproduced how I chose to solve them in the according week's folder. The majority of practical
exercises are from CryptoHack and CryptoPals, the latter based on the now defunct Matasano challenges, and Krypton from Over The Wire. Other cryptography based
challenges from different CTF platforms are noted.

The primary document, crypto.org, is my outline for how I planned this course, a checklist/syllabus of the work I layed out for myself, as well as a study outline
that is progressively filled with notes as I go, and other resources as I find them. It is outlaid as a 24 week course.

Everything for this course was completed in Doom Emacs.
