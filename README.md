# Self Guided Cryptography Course

The intent of this repository is to share my outline for a self-guided course in cryptography. The primary document, crypto.org, is that outline, as well as a checklist/syllabus of the work I layed out for myself, a study outline that is progressively filled with notes as I go, and other resources as I find them. It is outlaid as a 24 week course. Like anything in Emacs, if you know the joke, it has a soul and is a living document that will be continually updated.

The primary academic resources are Cristof Paar's Introduction to Cryptography lecture series available on YouTube and his book, Understanding Cryptography. As a supplemental book, Cryptography Engineering by Ferguson, Schneier and Kohno, was also used. Cracking Codes with Python by Sweigart was referrenced in order to solve some of the programming challenges, as this whole endeavor served the parallel purpose of me teaching myself Python. The books are the only non-free resources.

Exercises from the books that I personally considered worthwhile are reproduced how I chose to (or was able) solve them in the according projects's folder. The majority of practical exercises are from CryptoHack and CryptoPals, the latter based on the now defunct Matasano challenges, and Krypton from Over The Wire. Other cryptography based challenges from different CTF platforms are noted.

Digital cryptography is my focus here, but I consider it ultimately less interesting than cryptography from the WWII through Cold War era. That interest may find it's way here, if I can find the time to indulge myself.

If you find anything of value in this project, then it's been worth sharing. Thanks.

Everything for this course was completed in Doom Emacs, tmux, and Konsole.
