*** Notes:
*Kerckhoffs' Principle:* A cryptosytem should be secure even if the attacker knows all the details about the system, with the exception of the secret key.

When working with crypto, never perform operations on encoded strings. Always convert to bytes first! This should be the first step. Save base64 and hex for semi-human understandable pretty printing.

Cryptographic attacks can be broken down into the following categories:

    Classical cryptanalysis
    Implementation Attacks
    Social Engineering Attacks
    Reverse Engineering / Code Analysis

Key bit length and expected lifespan against decryption:

    | Key Length   | Security Estimation |
    |--------------+---------------------|
    | 56-64 bits   | A few hours/days    |
    | 112-128 bits | Possibly years      |
    | 256 bits     | Potentially decades |
    |--------------+---------------------|

*Professional paranoia will extend your lifespan.*

A security system is only as strong as its weakest link. That may not be the crypto... It's more than likely poor implementation, improper use of cryptographic primitives, unsecured channel or data, unsecure physical systems. These aspects are connected by links and sublinks. When analyzed, an /attack tree/ can be created. This allows for a more circumspect perspective in order to prevent succumbing to tunnel vision on one attack method.

*Example attack tree here*

Conversely, an /attack tree/ can facilitate the identification of system weaknesses, so that multiple links can be strengthened. If this is done thoroughly, a system can resist failure if one (or more) links fail. This is called /defense in depth/.

*Understanding the insane can prevent the unbelievable.*

Cryptography is not the solution, and it's (correct) implementation is extremely difficult. Conversely, cryptography is the easy part. Like a lock, when correctly installed, it will function as intended. The difficulty is in properly designing a system that is recursively secure as a whole.
