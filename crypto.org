*** Lecture Notes:
*Kerckhoffs' Principle:* A cryptosytem should be secure even if the attacker knows all the details about the system, with the exception of the secret key. i.e., the security of a cryptosystem should not depend on the secrecy of the algorithm, only the secrecy of the key.

When working with crypto, never perform operations on encoded strings. Always convert to bytes first! This should be the first step. Save base64 and hex for semi-human understandable pretty printing.

Cryptographic attacks can be broken down into the following categories:

    + Classical cryptanalysis (Ciphertext, known-plaintext, chosen-plaintext attack)
    + Collision analysis, such as birthday and meet-in-the-middle attacks
    + Implementation Attacks (Side-channel, information leakage)
    + Social Engineering Attacks
    + Brute-Force Attack (Exhaustive Key Search)
        For English alphabet substitution tables (i.e. keys), there are 26! = 2^88 keys... technically infeasible with average computing power, but vulnerable to statistical analysis
    + Reverse Engineering / Code Analysis

Key bit length and expected lifespan against decryption:

    | Key Length   | Security Estimation |
    |--------------+---------------------|
    | 56-64 bits   | A few hours/days    |
    | 112-128 bits | Possibly years      |
    | 256 bits     | Potentially decades |
    |--------------+---------------------|

    /Security estimations are based off of the extremely arbitrary metric of processing power and clock cycles to exhaustively calculate the bit permutations. This is rather unrealistic in practice./

*Professional paranoia will extend your lifespan.*

A security system is only as strong as its weakest link. That may not be the crypto... It's more than likely poor implementation, improper use of cryptographic primitives, unsecured channel or data, unsecure physical systems. These aspects are connected by links and sublinks. When analyzed, an /attack tree/ can be created. This allows for a more circumspect perspective in order to prevent succumbing to tunnel vision on one attack method.

Conversely, an /attack tree/ can facilitate the identification of system weaknesses, so that multiple links can be strengthened. If this is done thoroughly, a system can resist failure if one (or more) links fail. This is called /defense in depth/.

*Understanding the insane can prevent the unbelievable.*

Cryptography is not the solution, and it's (correct) implementation is extremely difficult. Conversely, cryptography is the easy part. Like a lock, when correctly installed, it will function as intended. The difficulty is in properly designing a system that is recursively secure as a whole.

There is /no mathematical proof of security/ for an practical cipher. The only way to have assurance is to (repeatedly) try to break it (and fail).

*** Exercise Notes:
The pwntools library is, at a glance, prefereable than other libraries in terms of being cleaner, simpler and more comprehensive. It also demonstrates that stealing other people's homework is effective even if you don't fully understand it. Which, while effectual, is less than ideal. Particularly in this instance, although being convenient, using it has an experimental learning curve all its own due to the laconic documentation.

The first ~20 challenges of CryptoHack have been a relatively easy introduction to basic concepts and getting hands on practice with Python. The learning curve is steep, and completion of many of the challenges requires as much coding ability as they do cryptographic understanding.

Cryptopals is by far the most challenging of the practical exercises. The notoriety of the original Matasano Challenges was warranted.

The Krypton war game from Over the Wire was an excellent exercise. It covered some classic ciphers, which allow for good coding practice, the Linux command knowledge and file navigation typical of OTW, some Viginere, and a culminating attack on a LFSR (linear-feedback shift register) stream cipher which is further detailed below.

For all of these (CryptoHack, Cryptopals, Krypton) I feel that later returning to them to 'resolve' the challenges will be worthwhile. To have solved it once is simply to have checked a box. To solve it elegantly is a much better goal, and serves the varying ends of (a) reinforcing my understanding of cryptography, and (b) strengthening my ability to program a solution.

*** Linear-Feedback Shift Register:
An LFSR is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state, the most common example being XOR.

The initial value of the LFSR is called the seed. Because the shift register's operation is deterministic, the values produced over the course of the stream is determined by its current state - which is constantly changing. However, because the register has a finite number of possible states, it will eventually repeat a cycle and demonstrate a pattern - making it vulnerable to exploitation. LFSRs indeed are not random.

They use varying functions such as Fibonacci sequences, Galois fields, XOR shifts, and matrices to encrypt the plaintext.

LFSRs have largely been replaced by Non-Linear Feedback Shift Registers, which are components of modern stream ciphers (particularly in RFID and smartcards). They are more resistant to cryptanalytic attacks than their antecedent.

*** Hamming Distance:
The *Hamming Distance* between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters (or bits) differ. i.e. it is a measurement of the minimum number of /substitutions/ necessary in order to change one string to the form of the other. It is specifically relevant to block codes, where equal-length strings are treated as vectors over a finite field.

**** Example of a Hamming Distance function in Python:
def hamming_distance(string1, string2):
    distance_counter = 0
    for n in range(len(string1)):
        if string1[n] != string2[n]:
            distance_counter += 1
    return distance_counter

*** Lecture Notes:

*a = r mod m* if m divides (a - r), which can also be written *m|(a-r)*. M is known as the modulus, and r is the remainder.

For any modulus, there are infinitely many remainders. These groups of remainders make up /equivalence classes./
